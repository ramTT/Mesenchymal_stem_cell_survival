# Mesenchymal Stem Cell Survival

**Aim:** Evaluate the difference in survival of transplanted allogenic and syngeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in injured spinal cord.

**Study design:** 

*Experimental groups:* I) SCI+syngeneic MSCs, II) SCI+allogenic MSCs.  

*Time points:* Transplantation 24 h post SCI. Sacrifice and evaluation at 3, 10 and 20 days post SCI.  

**Statistical analysis:**

* *Assumptions:* Normality was evaluated using Shapiro Wilk's test. Homogenity of variances was evaluated using Fligner Killeen's test.   

* *Student's t test* used if data was normally distributed and variances were equal. Student's t test with Welch correction was used when data was normally distributed but variances were not equal. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used when data was not normally distributed.
